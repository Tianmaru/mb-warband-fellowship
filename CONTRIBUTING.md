# Contributing

For the unlikely case somebody actually reads this:
Thank you for considering to contribute to **Fellowship**. This file will describe briefly, how you can contribute to this project.

## Artwork
If you want to create artwork, for example custom loading screens or a logo, I will gladly include it into this mod. Of course I will give you credit for the artwork, except you don't want to. Take a look at the "Textures" folder of Mount&Blade to see what is needed.

## Code
Maybe there is a feature, you would like to see in this mod, or you have a solution for a problem. Please tag every change made to the original module system with a "# FELLOWSHIP" comment. Also consider "fellowship_" as a prefix for new identifiers.

## Reporting Bugs and suggesting new ideas
Create Issues to report bugs and suggest new ideas.

I expect contributors to be friendly and respect each other.
