# mb-warband-fellowship

Fellowship is an upcoming mod for the video game [Mount and Blade: Warband](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Warband). It will focus on local coop campaign gameplay.
This repository is meant to be a backup copy for me and an example for other modders.

## Installing
To built the mod and install it for your copy of Mount and Blade: Warband, copy the "Native" module folder of the game and rename it, change export_dir in module_info.py to that new folders path and run build_module.bat.
Steam Workshop Version coming soon.
